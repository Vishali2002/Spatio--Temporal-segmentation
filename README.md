## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to analyze a provided video file to detect scene cuts and segment objects within the frames. The analysis will differentiate between foreground and background elements, identify abrupt and gradual transitions, and visualize the results.

## Objectives
1. Load the provided video file.
2. Extract individual frames from the video.
3. Apply spatio-temporal segmentation techniques (color thresholding, edge detection).
4. Detect scene cuts (hard and soft) based on intensity changes.
5. Mark detected scene cuts and create a summary of scene boundaries.
6. Visualize the results, including identified scene cuts and segmentation outputs.


## Methodology
1. **Load Video:** Efficiently load and preprocess the specified video file.
2. **Frame Extraction:** Extract frames from the video for analysis.
3. **Spatio-Temporal Segmentation:** 
   - Use color thresholding and edge detection to segment frames.
   - Track segmented objects over time.
4. **Scene Cut Detection:**
   - Identify hard cuts using pixel/histogram comparisons.
   - Detect gradual transitions through intensity changes.
5. **Mark Scene Cuts:** Highlight and summarize frames with detected scene cuts.
6. **Result Visualization:** Display frames and segmentation results.

## Results
- A total of **627 frames** were extracted from the video.
- **Total Hard Cuts Detected:** 2
- **Total Soft Cuts Detected:** 0

The analysis provided valuable insights into the videoâ€™s narrative structure and scene transitions.

## Discussion
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of video analysis techniques in understanding narrative flow. Key findings included the successful segmentation of foreground and background elements, along with the detection of significant scene cuts. 

## Conclusion
In summary, this project effectively extracted and analyzed video frames, revealing important transitions and object dynamics. The key takeaway is the role of scene cuts in video editing and storytelling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
